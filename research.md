# ABOUT ME

Highly motivated and research-driven expert with proficiency in code-based cryptography, seeking to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to cybersecurity solutions in the post-quantum era within an industry setting.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the GAE team at IRMAR, University of Rennes.

On September 14, 2020, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science at the University of Szeged, under the supervision of Gabor P. Nagy.

My research primarily focuses on error-correcting codes from algebraic geometry and their applications in cryptography.

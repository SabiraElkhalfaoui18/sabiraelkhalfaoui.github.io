# ABOUT ME

Highly motivated and research-driven expert with proficiency in code-based cryptography, seeking to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to cybersecurity solutions in the post-quantum era within an industry setting.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the GAE team at IRMAR, University of Rennes.

On September 14, 2020, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science at the University of Szeged, under the supervision of Gabor P. Nagy.

My research primarily focuses on error-correcting codes from algebraic geometry and their applications in cryptography.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

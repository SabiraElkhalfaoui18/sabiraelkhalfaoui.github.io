# ABOUT ME

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the GAE team at IRMAR, University of Rennes.
On September 14, 2020, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science at the University of Szeged, under the supervision of Gabor P. Nagy.
My research primarily focuses on error-correcting codes from algebraic geometry and their applications in cryptography.

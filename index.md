# ABOUT ME

I was recently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rennes, contributing to the Geometry and Effective Algebra team. Having completed my Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science at the University of Szeged in 2020, under the guidance of Professor Gabor P. Nagy. My research primarily focuses on error-correcting codes derived from algebraic geometry and cryptography, a captivating area at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. 

<!--Iâ€™m deeply passionate about delving into both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these codes. Beyond academia, I actively engage with the broader mathematical community, collaborating on projects and exchanging insights with fellow enthusiasts. With a firm commitment to expanding my knowledge and applying mathematical concepts to real-world challenges, I eagerly anticipate further exploration and discovery in this dynamic field. My journey in academia is driven by a desire to push boundaries and make meaningful contributions to the advancement of knowledge.-->

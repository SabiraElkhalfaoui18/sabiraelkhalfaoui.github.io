# ABOUT ME

I'm currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rennes, where I'm part of the Geometry and Effective Algebra team. I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science from the University of Szeged in 2020, under the mentorship of Professor Gabor P. Nagy.

My research revolves around a fascinating area where mathematics and computer science intersect: error-correcting codes derived from algebraic geometry. These codes play a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of digital information, making them indispensable in modern cryptography.

I'm passionate about exploring the theoretical underpinnings of these codes as well as their practical applications in safeguarding sensitive data. Outside of academia, I enjoy engaging with the broader mathematical community, collaborating on projects, and sharing insights with fellow enthusiasts.

I'm committed to advancing my understanding of mathematical concepts and leveraging this knowledge to address real-world challenges. I look forward to continuing my journey of exploration and discovery in this dynamic field.
